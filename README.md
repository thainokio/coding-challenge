# Real-Time Vocabulary Quiz Coding Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Quiz coding challenge! Your task is to create a technical solution for a real-time quiz feature for an English learning application. This feature will allow users to answer questions in real-time, compete with others, and see their scores updated live on a leaderboard.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **User Participation**:
   - Users should be able to join a quiz session using a unique quiz ID.
   - The system should support multiple users joining the same quiz session simultaneously.

2. **Real-Time Score Updates**:
   - As users submit answers, their scores should be updated in real-time.
   - The scoring system must be accurate and consistent.

3. **Real-Time Leaderboard**:
   - A leaderboard should display the current standings of all participants.
   - The leaderboard should update promptly as scores change.

## Challenge Requirements

### Part 1: System Design

1. **System Design Document**:
   - **Architecture Diagram**: Create an architecture diagram illustrating how different system components interact. This should include all components required for the feature, including the server, client applications, database, and any external services.
   - **Component Description**: Describe each component's role in the system.
   - **Data Flow**: Explain how data flows through the system from when a user joins a quiz to when the leaderboard is updated.
   - **Technologies and Tools**: List and justify the technologies and tools chosen for each component.

### Part 2: Implementation

1. **Pick a Component**:
   - Implement one of the core components below using the technologies that you are comfortable with. The rest of the system can be mocked using mock services or data.

2. **Requirements for the Implemented Component**:
   - **Real-time Quiz Participation**: Users should be able to join a quiz session using a unique quiz ID.
   - **Real-time Score Updates**: Users' scores should be updated in real-time as they submit answers.
   - **Real-time Leaderboard**: A leaderboard should display the current standings of all participants in real-time.

3. **Build For the Future**:
   - **Scalability**: Design and implement your component with scalability in mind. Consider how the system would handle a large number of users or quiz sessions. Discuss any trade-offs you made in your design and implementation.
   - **Performance**: Your component should perform well even under heavy load. Consider how you can optimize your code and your use of resources to ensure high performance.
   - **Reliability**: Your component should be reliable and handle errors gracefully. Consider how you can make your component resilient to failures.
   - **Maintainability**: Your code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to maintain. Consider how you can make it easy for other developers to understand and modify your code.
   - **Monitoring and Observability**: Discuss how you would monitor the performance of your component and diagnose issues. Consider how you can make your component observable.
